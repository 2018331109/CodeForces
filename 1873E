E. Building an Aquarium

STATEMENT
You love fish, that's why you have decided to build an aquarium. You have a piece of coral made of n columns, 
the i-th of which is ai units tall. Afterwards, you will build a tank around the coral as follows:
Pick an integer h≥1
 — the height of the tank. Build walls of height h on either side of the tank.
Then, fill the tank up with water so that the height of each column is h, unless the coral is taller than h; 
then no water should be added to this column. 
For example, with a=[3,1,2,4,6,2,5] and a height of h=4, you will end up using a total of w=8 units of water, as shown.
You can use at most x units of water to fill up the tank, but you want to build the biggest tank possible. 
What is the largest value of h you can select?

SOLUTION
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define int unsigned long long

int  md = 1e17;

void solve()
{
    int  n;
    int  x;
    cin >> n >> x;
    int  a[n];
    for(int  i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        cin >> a[i];
    }

    int  l = 0, r = md;
    int  res = 1;
    while(l < r)
    {
        int  mid = l + (r - l) / (int )2;

        int  xx = 0;

        for(int  i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if(a[i] < mid)
            {
                xx += (mid - a[i]);
            }
        }

        if(xx <= x)
        {
            res = mid;
            l = mid + 1;
        }
        else
        {
            r = mid;
        }
    }

    cout << (int )res << endl;
}

signed main()
{
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int  test=1;
    cin>>test;
    for(int  t=1; t<=test; t++)
    {
        solve();
    }

}

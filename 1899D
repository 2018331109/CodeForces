D. Yarik and Musical Notes

STATEMENT
Yarik is a big fan of many kinds of music. But Yarik loves not only listening to music but also writing it. 
He likes electronic music most of all,  so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, 
is best for it. Since Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of 2k, 
where k≥1 — a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, 
so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes (a,b), where a=2k and b=2l, 
he denotes by the integer ab. For example, if a=8=23, b=4=22, then the combination (a,b) is denoted by 
the integer ab=84=4096. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., 
the combination (64,2) is also denoted by the integer 4096=642. Yarik has already chosen n notes that 
he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, 
he has written them down as an array a of length n, then the note i is bi=2ai. The integers in array a can be repeated.
The melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes bi,bj
(i<j) exist such that the combination (bi,bj) is equal to the combination (bj,bi). In other words, 
he wants to count the number of pairs (i,j) (i<j) such that bbji=bbij. Help him find the number of such pairs.
